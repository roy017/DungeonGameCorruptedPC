# DungeonGame_CorruptedPC

Game project that is inspired by "Enter the Gungeon, created in Unity.
It's a roguelike game, with art created by myself and an artist.
This project was created to practice my game development skills, and to see if I have the abillity to recreate a game that I like.

The project has working playable characters, and enemies, shooting mechanic is working.
The project right now is close to having a working procedurally generated dungeon.
Once the procedurally generated dungeon part is done, an inventory system will be made.
